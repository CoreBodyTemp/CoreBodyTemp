## FAQ

### **Q:** Where can I find more developer notes?

**A:** Please visit our developer notes on https://corebodytemp.com/pages/tech-core-developer-information

### **Q:** How can I Bluetooth discover a CORE sensor?

**A:** Sensors that implement the CoreTemp Service will advertise the UUID of the CoreTemp Service in their advertisement data. Just filter your results for the UUID `00002100-5B1E-4347-B07C-97B514DAE121` in the list of advertised 128bit services. Please do not rely on the Bluetooth advertised name, it may not always contain the String `CORE`.
